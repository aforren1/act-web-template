## Original

The original repository is https://github.com/yandeu/phaser-project-template-es6.

The following changes were made:
 - Updated icons (see src/icons/README for info), and updated paths to those icons
 - Removed PWA materials (we'll never use PWAs, AFAIK)
 - Added https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin to strip comments from production build
 - Updated css in index.html
 - Added heroku-specific files (Procfile, requirements.txt, runtime.txt, server.py)
 - Can probably remove serve dependency? We're going to use a python server
